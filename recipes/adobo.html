    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The dictionary defines adobo as "a spicy dish or sauce." In the Philippines, adobo refers to a centuries-old process of preserving food by stewing it in vinegar and salt.</p>
    <p>It was Spanish colonialists in the 16th and 17th century who gave the native dish its current name, and Chinese traders who introduced soy sauce to replace the salt.</p>
