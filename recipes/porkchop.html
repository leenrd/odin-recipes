    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A pork chop, like other meat chops, is a loin cut taken perpendicular to the spine of the pig and is usually a rib or part of a vertebra. Pork chops are unprocessed and leaner than other cuts. Chops are commonly served as an individual portion, and can be accompanied with applesauce, vegetables, and other sides.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 Porkchop</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>2/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Before frying pork chops, first salt and pepper them on both sides. You can be very generous with the seasonings.</li>
        <li>heat a little vegetable oil, maybe two tablespoons, or a little butter (or both!) in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. The fat should be sizzling hot when you add the chops to the pan. </li>
        <li>When one side is beautifully golden brown (about three or four minutes), turn, and then knock the flames down to medium so the middle can completely cook before the outside is overdone.</li>
        
    </ol>
